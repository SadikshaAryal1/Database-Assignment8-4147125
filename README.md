                             Webster University Library Management Application (WULM) 1.0 Feb 2020
WULM is designed to manage book borrowing and returning processes at Webster University Library. When a user enters the "Book Loan Information" screen they will get information regarding availability of books (which books are available and which have already been borrowed by students).

Furthermore, from this screen, the user can have a clear idea on which books are available for borrowing and which books are unavailable and which are already borrowed by other students. Each time a book is borrowed by a student, the information such as: Author, Book name (as in name of borrowed book), Due date to return the book, loan ID, and Student ID is stored in Book Loan Information Database.

This screen of the application is one of the most integral parts of the application as it provides information regarding one of the most important processes in the Webster Library System.

The other screens are described below.
